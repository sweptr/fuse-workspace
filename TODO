CREATION OF A RESOURCE THROUGH mkdir.
-------------------------------------

Now the creation of a resource like an nfs server and a smb server is done by:

export WORKSPACE_URI=nfs://ip4address
mkdir %nfsserver%

now add the ability to create a resource by using the environment variable

export WORKSPACE_URI_FILE=/path/to/some/file
mkdir %server%

fuse-workspace will now test the file for sane values. If that's the case,
it will create the resource.

The reason for using a file for the uri is that advanced settings are possible.
When using the WORKSPACE_URI environment variable, for example settings for
credentials cannot be used.

I'm not sure about the format yet, but an example for a WORKSPACE_URI_FILE can be:

SMB_URI=smb://ipv4address
SMB_AUTHMETHOD=password:file://some/path/to/a/file
SMB_OVERRIDE_UID=
